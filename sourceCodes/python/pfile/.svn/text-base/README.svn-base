Python library for writing GMTK PFile's.

The normal way to generate PFiles is to use the obs-print utility, which is
part of the GMTK installation. There are limitations on the form of inputs
that obs-print will accept. The most flexible approach is to wrap the relevant
bits of GMTK's featureFileIO into a Python library.

The featureFileIO code was taken from the GMTK repository (hgid:eed08fd3fb16).
A swig interface file (swig.i) is used to create a SWIG C++ to Python module
(swig_wrap.cxx, pfile.py).

You do not need SWIG to compile the underyling code, just g++. You will have
to change PYINCLUDE, the current value works on Nikola 5 machines. If you need
to regenerate swig_wrap.cxx and pfile.py, then you need SWIG.

The current SWIG C++ to Python wrapper was compiled using SWIG 2.0.1.

----

One problem is that Nikola 4 machines only have python 2.5, while Nikola 5
machines have python 2.6. Oddly enough, compiling the wrapper with python 2.5
on a Nikola 4 box allows the resulting library to work on both Nikola 4 and
Nikola 5 machines.
